  _description: "Deals damage over time that decrease every time this effect is applied.
    Step on it to regenerate the power of the trap.  I remember the first time that
    I saw the Fracture opening: I was like a child in front of a magician, mesmerized
    by all the colors flowing out of the portal right in front of me. The liquid
    ink that leaked trough the Fracture was moving in an unnatural way, almost as
    if it didn\u2019t follow the rules of the world. After it compacted itself in
    a humanoid figure, I faced a demon with three heads in a battle, a blue lady
    that was crying blood: I don\u2019t recall all the details, ages have passed,
    but those colors\u2026 they feel like a gentle caress before the slap, even to
    this day. I\u2019m addicted to that magical feeling. "
