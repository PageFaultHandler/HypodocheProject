  _description: 'Kite that moves around the arena randomly, dealing damage.  "Swayed
    by the wind, tiny pieces of paper fly trough the sky, slowly. Li Yan is mesmerized:
    never has she seen something so beautiful before. She rushes to the crowded plaza,
    looking at the other kids that were playing with their kites. Everyone seems
    to have a lot of fun. Everyone except... one of them, a little girl. She is crying
    over her toy, broken: Li Yan quickly rushes to help her fix it, even if she doesn''t
    know how. It''s just an instict. Her hands move on their own, and the toy is
    fixed in no time. The smile her new friend has on her face is something she will
    never forget:  Li Yan smiles back, and deep down knows that this is what she,
    from now on, will do for the rest of her life." - Li Yan'
