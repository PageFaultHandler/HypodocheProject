  _description: "Little doll that recovers your stamina. Has a cooldown of 16 seconds. 
    -Halja story- \u201CLife is what happens between a smile\u2026 and the next one.
    Halja always thought about smiling as the core experience of life: even trough
    tough days, she pushes forward with a smile on her face. Determined to be the
    strength of everyone around her, she consults her patients to help cure any illness
    that may afflict them. Days like today, tough, throw a wrench into her plans:
    even in the relative heaven that\u2019s Earth, mortal diseases still exists.
    And when cuddling the little kid that is dying little by little right in front
    of her, she can\u2019t do anything else than face the fact that even if nobody
    should deserve to die in such a terrible way, since no evil is present in the
    human nature\u2026 some still do. And it is not fair. She stands up, takes a
    little doll from near the bed and puts it into the tiny arms of the child. Concealing
    a tear, she leaves the room\u2026 and smiles: but to Halja, her life isn\u2019t
    a utopia.\u201D "
