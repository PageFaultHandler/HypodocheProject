  _description: "If hit by any projectile, the Banshee Statue stores inside \xBC
    of its power. If the player or any enemy enters the area surrounding the Banshee
    Statue, they get damaged for sum of the damages received. After dealing damages,
    it deactivates until the next instance of damage is received.  Strange statue
    of a screaming woman: if there is complete silence sometimes I hear it quietly
    scream, almost as if it was in pain. I don't know the story about this memorabilia,
    but it reminds me of the old world. In a way, i feel like the pain it depicts
    is similar to the one I feel every day, here, but also it reminds me how hard
    was my life before. Do I even miss it? I don't remember the old world well anymore,
    it melted from my memory as snow in the sun... "
