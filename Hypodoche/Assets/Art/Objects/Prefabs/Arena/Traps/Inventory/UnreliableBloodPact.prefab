  _description: "Sacrifice health to gain a random amount of permanent power. Has
    a cooldown of 26 seconds. If any enemy gets too close, they get damaged.  -Caputmallei
    Story- \u201CTo those who listen, Caputmallei preaches dark tales, but no matter
    how much he tries, often ignorance prevails:  he saw in his dreams what others
    can not, the far away land where the battles are fought.  In this concealed place,
    long lost in the stars, an injured owl rests, mending his scars.  \u2018He\u2019s
    the one who we should pray!\u2019 Caputmallei screams as loud as he may.  But
    nobody listens, and that is ok, because at the end of the day nobody would care
    either way.\u201D "
