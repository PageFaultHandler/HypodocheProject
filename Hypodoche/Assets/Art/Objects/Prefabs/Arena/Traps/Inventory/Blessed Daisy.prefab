  _description: "Blessed flower that grows each 14 seconds and stays active for 7:
    when fully blossomed, the damage of the player is +40% if inside the blessed
    area for as long as it is active.  This little flower that keeps blossoming and
    dying is a gift from the Oracle, a \u201Cmemento mori\u201D that helps me to
    be focused even in my tougher days. It smells kinda funny, fresh\u2026 but also
    acre: when I smell it, I feel a little dizzy. I can\u2019t tell if it reminds
    me of something of my past\u2026  maybe It just reminds me of long lost times
    of joy, when I used to play on the white beaches of Zakynthos as a child. The
    sun was warm and the gentle breeze cuddled me. The sea was the only liquid that
    touched my skin. Now plenty scars cover it, symbol of the long battle I fight
    every day. "
