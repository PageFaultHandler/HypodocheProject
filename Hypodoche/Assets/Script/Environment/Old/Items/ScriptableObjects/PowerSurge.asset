  _description: 'I once found a lost soul, a memory of dust in the warm universe,
    that was crawling towards a star. They were lost, and I with them. I existed
    just as a thought: I was, and am, just a soundless voice with no sight. But I
    saw the soul, and I played with them. I noticed they were sad: their differences
    hurt; so I sliced them, and the sould was thankfull.  Now they can be a soul
    and be two souls, and that is good.'
