  _description: " Pool of tar that heavily slows who\u2019s inside, and heavily enhances
    damages.This liquid brings you back to a point in your life were you were lost,
    and you were found. Bitter taste in your mouth, unable to move. The lingering
    fear of the unknown. You lied there, lying to yourself, pretending it was just
    a bad dream,  even if know you know that it was the beginning of your new reality.
    Or maybe this is all a dream, you can tell for certain."
